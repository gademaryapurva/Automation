create a folder- GitSample
create a text file = apurva.txt
command prompt cd path
cd /d D:\
commands:
git init = create local repo
check folder make hidden folders

Staging = tell ur locale repo to commit
git add * = it will push ur code to staging area and tell the code is ready to commit

Commit = files in staging area will pushed to local repo 
git commit -m "This is my first commit"

Push = it will push the code from locale to cloud 
git push origin master

git add *
git status
git commit -m "adding file apurva.txt"

give credintials there = git config --global --edit
			 git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    			 git config --global user.email you@example.com


git remote add origin https://github.com/gademaryapurva/Automation.git

git push origin master 
( main branch is called master)

create sample.txt

git branch
git add path of the file
git commit -m "adding sample.txt"
git push origin master

edit apurva.txt

git add *
git commit -m "updated"
git push origin master

branching and cloning = u will take code from git to local repo that is cloning
copy repo path: git clone https://github.com/sample.git

create new folder for another person:
next time to get the update from the git then(changes may done by original person)
git add * from original person 
git commit -m "updated the file"
git push origin master

now the new person wants to take the update:
got to new person folder path
git pull origin master 

Branch: copy of your code, copy of master
create a copy of master branch and give it a name called development branch.
after updating or developing the branch development they merge both branch and master.
master is the production code.

create 3rd folder Development or create in gitsample


git checkout -b development
checking out the code and creating a branch and give it a name.
which branch u r pointing to 
git branch
git checkout master
git branch
git checkout development
git add *
git commit -m "commit in dev branch"
git push origin development

if it is new 3rd folder: git clone link of samplefolder
cd samplevivek
git checkout -b feature
to see which branch u r pointing git branch

git add *
git commit -m "feature branch update"
git push origin feature


git clone link
cd sample
git branch
it will point to master no branches get downloaded.

Merge:
git branch
feature and master
edit one file in 3rd folder
git add *
git commit -m "changed the sample.txt"
git push origin feature

switch to the master to merge
git checkout master
git merge feature
git add *
git comit -m "merged changes"
git push origin master

go to github and refresh
